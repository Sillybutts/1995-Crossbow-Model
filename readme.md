## Description

3D Model Video Overview: WIP

This is my hand-crafted 3d model of a 1995 Kenner Crossbow blaster. The Crossbow is (or at least used to be when I was first getting into the hobby) an extremely sought after blaster. Unfortunately, many Crossbows that exist today are damaged, modded, missing parts, or are just old and fragile (they are almost 30 years old now!). 

This model is meant to be modified by users to make 3d printable 1995 Crossbow homemades. 
Here's some possible uses for this model:
- Reference for other projects
- Repair parts for broken original Crossbows
- Single shot or hoppered homemade internals
- SkewBow-style mag fed blasters
- Flycore???
- HPA with a bottle in the stock
- Room decor?

This model is extremely accurate to the original blaster, with a few caveats:
- The muzzle and top barrel hole are slightly modified to be closer to a lightly modded 1995 Crossbow, circa early 2000s.
- The front grip area gripping ribs are slightly different than the original blaster. This is due to modeling difficulties. Technically, the ridges should be cut out of the rest of the foregrip shape, not raised ribs.
- There is supposed to be a "leathery" texture across several areas of the blaster. The tools I use don't have a good way to add this texture to the model, so I've omitted it. (Foregrip, back of the grip, front of the stock slot, the little circle near the top of the blaster, the buttplate, and some areas inside the priming handle.)
- The very top of the grip, where it meets with the rest of the shell, is a bit iffy. It should be more rounded, but the model just didn't want to cooperate.
- There are no screw holes in my model
- There is no empty space inside the blaster in my model. It's all solid.


This model is open to everyone, and I hope that you guys have some fun with it! Make sure to share any cool things you do with the model!
Also, please credit me in any designs you use this model for. Thanks :)

## Helpers

This model is roughly based on scans of a 1995 Crossbow by Lucian on Nerfhaven, and some modeling work done by CaptainSlug on Nerfhaven. The scans were used as a rough guideline in earlier versions of my model, and were used to fill in some limited areas where I couldn't really get a clean model (mainly the front grip area). 

The rest of the model was done by me (Sillybutts), using reference pictures and measuring the several 1995 Crossbows I own with calipers.
